Address = ` A Bitcoin address is similar to a
physical address or an email. It is the only
information you need to provide for
someone to pay you with Bitcoin. An
important difference, however, is that each
address should only be used for a single
transaction. Typically consists of between
26 and 35 alphanumeric characters.`

Altcoin = ` A form of cryptocurrency that
has the same decentralized, peer-to-peer
principles as bitcoin, but which uses its
own blockchain and has its own rules of
operation. Altcoin is the term used to
describe those digital currencies that do
not have as big a market capitalization or
do not have the recognition of the current
incumbent cryptocurrencies such as
bitcoin, litecoin and dogecoin.`

ASIC = ` ASIC stands for application
specific integrated circuit, which is a
specialized silicon chip that performs just
one task. In the digital currency space,
these chips process SHA-256 in order to
mine bitcoin and validate transactions.`

ASICMiner = ` An ASIC Miner is the
hardware that houses the chip of the
same name. You put them into your
Internet connection via a modem or
wireless mode. Bitcoin is independent of
your desktop computer.`

Bit = ` Bit is a common unit used to
designate a sub-unit of a bitcoin - 1,000,000
bits is equal to 1 bitcoin (BTC or ). This
unit is usually more convenient for pricing,
tips, goods and services.`

Bitcoin = `A form of
digital currency created in 2009, that is
created and distributed on a peer-to-peer
basis. It has no central bank - transactions
are conducted directly between
individuals. Bitcoin is the most popular
kind of cryptocurrency.`

BitcoinIndex = ` The live bitcoin news
bitcoin index is a weighted average index
that shows the value of one bitcoin versus
one single unit of currency of each of the
majors in the Forex space – EUR, USD,
JPY, GBP and AUD.`

BitcoinWhitepaper = ` Written by Satoshi
Nakamoto in 2008, it describes the
original plan and protocol for Bitcoin.
BitPay - BitPay is a payment processing
company and software that allows
merchants such as eBay, Amazon and other
online shopping channels to accept bitcoin
as payment for its goods and services.`

BitPay = ` BitPay is a payment processing
company and software that allows
merchants such as eBay, Amazon and other
online shopping channels to accept bitcoin
as payment for its goods and services.`

Block = ` A block is a record in the block
chain that contains and confirms many
waiting transactions. Roughly every 10
minutes, on average, a new block
including transactions is appended to the
block chain through mining.`

BlockReward = ` This term refers to the
“reward” that the Miner receives for
successfully hashing a transaction block.`

Blockchain = ` A digital file distributed to
everyone participating in a crypto-
currency network. The blockchain acts as
a kind of general ledger, keeping track of
all the transactions that happen in the
network. Everyone can look at the
blockchain to see what transactions have
happened on the network, and the
blockchain is sealed using cryptography
so that no one can tamper with it.`

ColdStorage = ` A security measure for
Bitcoin that is disconnected from the
internet. Could be a paper wallet [see
below], USB stick or hardware wallet.`

Confirmation = ` Confirmation means that
a transaction has been processed by the
network and is highly unlikely to be
reversed. Transactions receive a
confirmation when they are included in a
block and for each subsequent block. Even a
single confirmation can be considered
secure for low value transactions, although
for larger amounts like $1,000 US, it makes
sense to wait for 6 confirmations or more.
Each confirmation exponentially decreases
the risk of a reversed transaction.`

Cryptocurrency = ` The broad name for
digital currencies that use blockchain
technology to work on a peer-to-peer basis.
Cryptocurrencies don't need a bank to
carry out transactions between individuals.
The nature of the blockchain means that
individuals can transact between each
other, even if they don't trust each other.
The cryptocurrency network keeps track of
all the transactions and ensures that no one
tries to renege on a transaction.`

Cryptography = ` Cryptography is the
branch of mathematics that lets us create
mathematical proofs that provide high
levels of security. Online commerce and
banking already uses cryptography. In the
case of Bitcoin, cryptography is used to
make it impossible for anybody to spend
funds from another user's wallet or to
corrupt the block chain. It can also be used
to encrypt a wallet, so that it cannot be
used without a password.`

DoubleSpend = ` If a malicious user tries to
spend their bitcoins with two different
recipients at the same time, this is double
spending. Bitcoin mining and the block
chain are there to create a consensus on
the network about which of the two
transactions will confirm and be
considered valid.`

Exchange = ` An exchange is exactly how it
sounds, somewhere where account holders
can exchange one digital currency for another
or a Fiat currency for a digital currency.`

Faucet = ` When an individual or team of
individuals develop a digital currency,
they may pre-mine a certain amount
before release and give these pre-mined
coins away. This is called a faucet.`

FIAT = ` A Fiat currency is a traditional
paperback currency that is regulated by an
organization such as the central bank.
Examples include the Euro, the US dollar
and the Australian dollar.`

GenesisBlock = ` The very first block in the
block chain of any digital currency.`

Hash = ` A cryptographic hash is a
mathematical function that takes a file
and produces a relatively short code that
can be used to identify that file. A hash
has a couple of key properties: It is unique.
Only a particular file can produce a
particular hash, and two different files
will never produce the same hash. It
cannot be reversed. You can't work out
what a file was by looking at its hash.
Hashing is used to prove that a set of data
has not been tampered with. It is what
makes bitcoin mining possible.`

HashRate = ` The hash rate is the
measuring unit of the processing power of
the Bitcoin network. The Bitcoin network
must make intensive mathematical
operations for security purposes. When
the network reached a hash rate of 10
Th/s, it meant it could make 10 trillion
calculations per second.`

Microtransaction = ` The ability to pay for
things in very small sums thanks to the
fact that Bitcoin may be extended to 8
decimal places. Microtransactions are
especially important to Bitcoin casinos by
providing players the ability to deposit and
gamble fractions of Bitcoins.`

Mining = ` The act of producing units of a
cryptocurrency (such as bitcoins) through
some kind of effort. The effort is required
so that people can't just create infinite
amounts of the digital currency, which
would devalue it. In bitcoin, mining
requires computing power. Here is a
detailed description of how mining works.
Bitcoin mining is the process of making
computer hardware do mathematical
calculations for the Bitcoin network to
confirm transactions and increase security.
As a reward for their services, Bitcoin
miners can collect transaction fees for the
transactions they confirm, along with
newly created bitcoins. Mining is a
specialized and competitive market where
the rewards are divided up according to
how much calculation is done. Not all
Bitcoin users do Bitcoin mining, and it is
not an easy way to make money.`

MtGox = ` one of the first Bitcoin
exchanges that began liquidating after
more than 850,000 of its users’ Bitcoins
were lost or stolen – an amount equal to
more than $450,000,000 at the time.`

Output = ` When a bitcoin transaction takes
place, the output refers to the destination
address used in the transaction.`

PaperWallet =` Some people prefer to store
their bitcoin in the paper wallet – a form of
cold storage – in order to improve security.
The term simply refers to a printed sheet of
paper that holds a number of public bitcoin
addresses and corresponding private keys.`

P2P = ` Peer-to-peer refers to systems that
work like an organized collective by
allowing each individual to interact
directly with the others. In the case of
Bitcoin, the network is built in such a way
that each user is broadcasting the
transactions of other users. And, crucially,
no bank is required as a third party.`

PrivateKey = ` A private key is a secret
piece of data that proves your right to
spend bitcoins from a specific wallet
through a cryptographic signature. Your
private key(s) are stored in your computer
if you use a software wallet; they are
stored on some remote servers if you use a
web wallet. Private keys must never be
revealed as they allow you to spend
bitcoins for their respective Bitcoin wallet.`

ProofofWorkPoW = ` Proof of work
simply refers to the output of any efforts to
mine bitcoin. In the bitcoin block chain, the
hashing of a block takes time and effort,
meaning the hash block can be considered
proof of work.`

PublicKey = ` The public key is a string of
digits and letters (your bitcoin address).
When hashed with a corresponding string
known as a private key it digitally signs
and online communication.`

Satoshi = ` A Bitcoin “cent”, the smallest
form of Bitcoins. One Bitcoin is equal to 1
million Satoshis.`

SatoshiNakamoto = ` the creator of Bitcoin
and the author of the original Bitcoin
whitepaper and code. His real identity is
unknown to the world.`

SilkRoad = ` An underground website, as
part of the “dark web”, that was essentially
a black market online. One could
purchase illegal drugs, organs or hire
assassins online. The site used
cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and was
shut down in 2013 by the FBI.`

SHA256 = ` Every digital currency must
have a cryptographic function that
dictates how the hash is constructed. In
bitcoin, SHA-256 is this function, and is
used as the basis for hash creation (i.e.
bitcoin’s proof of work).`

Signature = ` A cryptographic signature is a
mathematical mechanism that allows
someone to prove ownership. In the case
of Bitcoin, a Bitcoin wallet and its private
key(s) are linked by some mathematical
magic. When your Bitcoin software signs
a transaction with the appropriate private
key, the whole network can see that the
signature matches the bitcoins being
spent. However, there is no way for the
world to guess your private key to steal
your hard-earned bitcoins.`

TransactionFee = ` Some transactions that
occur in the bitcoin block chain contain
transaction fees. These transaction fees
are paid to the miner that hashes the block
in question.`

Wallet = ` A Bitcoin wallet is loosely the
equivalent of a physical wallet on the
Bitcoin network. The wallet actually
contains your private key(s) which allow
you to spend the bitcoins allocated to it in
the block chain. Each Bitcoin wallet can
show you the total balance of all bitcoins it
controls and lets you pay a specific
amount to a specific person, just like a real
wallet. This is different from credit cards
where you are charged by the merchant.`
